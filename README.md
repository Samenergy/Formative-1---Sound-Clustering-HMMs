# Sound Clustering Assignment

This project explores clustering techniques applied to sound data. The main work is contained in the `SoundClustering.ipynb` Jupyter notebook.

## Contents

- **SoundClustering.ipynb**: The main notebook containing code, analysis, and results for sound clustering.
- **README.md**: Project overview and instructions.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook
- Common data science libraries (NumPy, pandas, scikit-learn, matplotlib, etc.)

You can install the required libraries using:

```bash
pip install numpy pandas scikit-learn matplotlib
```

### Running the Notebook

1. Open a terminal and navigate to the project directory.
2. Start Jupyter Notebook:

   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```

3. Open `SoundClustering.ipynb` in your browser.
4. Run the cells in order to reproduce the analysis.

## Project Description

This assignment demonstrates how to cluster sound data using machine learning techniques. The notebook covers:

- Loading and preprocessing sound data
- Feature extraction
- Applying clustering algorithms (e.g., KMeans)
- Visualizing and interpreting the results


## Results

Results, plots, and analysis are included in the notebook.
